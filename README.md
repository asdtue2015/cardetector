The purpose of this branch is to setup CI services using Travis-CI.
The last attempt was promising but didn't succeed due to the time limitation given by the Travis-CI platform.
Also, the CI can only check for proper compilation and correct unit test. The Travis-CI instances don't allow access to a CUDA-compatible GPU; which is a requirement for complete functional tests.
